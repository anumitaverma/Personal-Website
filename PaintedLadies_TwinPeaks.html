<div>Do not worry guys, painted ladies is not objectification in any way. In fact they are are four  Victorian houses which are painted in four different solid colors making them stand out from the remaining houses. What makes them so special? Well San Francisco has been known for quaint Victorian houses. Being one of the oldest cities in America with a rich culture, Victorian houses date back to 1900’s. Though most of the houses have been remodeled all around the States, SFC has still managed to preserve some and Painted ladies are amongst those! The best time to go there is on a weekday, around sunset when the view is beautiful and the mood is tranquil. </div>

<div class="space">Want to look at SFC from atop? Upset that SFC does not have skyliners? Well you’re at the right place because we have our our natural skyliners! Twin peaks- situated on the outskirts of SFC is a beautiful place to go to for tranquility (mental not physical – it is really windy up there!). To get to Twin Peaks, many people prefer driving or uber-ing, but some like me actually prefer walking! When I planned my trip to the Twin Peaks, I decided to take the uber to the Painted Ladies and then walked to the Twin Peaks. The walk is definitely  treacherous  however it is worth the pain the sweat because the view is breathtaking, quite literally.I would recommend beginning earlier in your day as by the time I got there, the winds had become fierce and the sun was way beyond set. Nevertheless, seeing the hue of pink merging into purple above the Transamerica building is what held my gaze.. and my heart!</div>
