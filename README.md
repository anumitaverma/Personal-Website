# Website
When I was in California for my internship, I was inspired to create a travel blog about my adventures. 
In addition to that, I also wanted to revamp my website. Combining the two and working on my website was a great way for me to delve into a separate world and put expand my imagination. 
This project contains the source codes for my website. Website isn't complete yet, still working on adding a lot of other things!
